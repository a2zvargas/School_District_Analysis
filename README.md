# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

There is evidence that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders have been altered.  The extent of this grade altering is not known, so the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders will be removed, and the school district analysis will be performed again with the updated data.

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the school district's academic performance before and after the Thomas High School ninth graders math and reading scores were removed.
